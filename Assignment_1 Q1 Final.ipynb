    "The agent can take four actions in each cell: 'RIGHT', 'DOWN', 'UP', 'LEFT'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell is represented as $(x,y)$, where $x$ indicates row number and $y$ indicates column number. Action 'UP' takes the agent from cell $(x,y)$ to $(x+1,y)$. Action 'DOWN' takes the agent from cell $(x,y)$ to $(x-1,y)$. Action 'RIGHT' takes the agent from cell $(x,y)$ to $(x,y+1)$. Action 'LEFT' takes the agent from cell $(x,y)$ to $(x,y-1)$. The triplet $(s,a,s')$  indicates that taking action $a$ at state $s$ leads to state $s'$. Actions 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' cost 10 units for all $(s,a,s')$. Actions 'UP' or 'DOWN' cost 1 unit for all  $(s,a,s')$.  The agent cannot move into cells that are shaded. Assume that the agent knows the boundaries of the maze and has full observability. Consequently, at the bottom (row 0) and top (row 15), the agent will not take actions 'DOWN' and 'UP', respectively; at left (column 0) and right (column 23) columns, the agent will not take 'LEFT' and 'RIGHT' actions, respectively. Similalry, the agent will not take actions that lead to shaded region in the maze.\n",

    "Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Worst case for Time Complexity:}$ The algorithm visits every square on the maze map before arriving at the goal. This happens when the initial and goal states are on opposite corners of the map, and the walls are arranged in a way that forces the agent to take a snake like path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: The worst case time-complexity is linear in number of squares that can be visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Worst case for Space Complexity:}$ The main memory usage are the deque data structure used to store the frontier, and the set data structure used to store visited nodes. The size of set will never exceed the number of visitable squares in the maze. It can reach the maximum size if all squares are visited before reaching goal state, so the worst case space complexity is at least linear in number of squares that can be visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deque data structure keeps track of the frontier, and the frontier is always a subset of the set of all squares in the maze, so deque cannot have a higher space complexity than linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: The worst case space-complexity is linear in number of visitable squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Completeness:}$ Since the algorithm allows the agent to visit every single reachable state, the algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution when there is one. It will also correctly report failure when no solution exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: Algorithm is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Cost optimality:}$ From the path costs given (10 for horizontal movement, 1 for vertical movement) it is clear that we want to minimize horizontal movement. The path cost for the solution given is 39 with only 3 horizontal moves, the smallest possible. However, we cannot guarantee cost optimality for all instances of the Maze problem (possibly with different wall configurations, initial and goal states) since we did not account for costs when expanding nodes.\n",

    "Conclusion: The worst case time-complexity is linear in number of squares that can be visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Worst case for Space Complexity:}$ The main memory usage are the list data structure used to store the frontier, and the set data structure used to store visited nodes. The size of set will never exceed the number of squares in the maze. It can reach the maximum size if all squares are visited before reaching goal state, so the worst case space complexity is at least linear in number of squares that can be visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list data structure keeps track of the frontier, and the frontier is always a subset of the set of all squares in the maze, so list cannot have a higher space complexity than linear.\n",

    "Conclusion: The worst case space-complexity is linear in number of squares that can be visited.\n",

    "Conclusion: Algorithm is complete.\n",
    "\n",

    "$\\textbf{Worst case for Time Complexity:}$ Both algorithms expand nodes in an order that makes the agent visit every square on the maze map before arriving at the goal. This worst case can be achieved: by setting the initial and goal states on opposite corners of the map, and arrange the walls in a way that forces the agent to take a snake like path through all the squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, iterative deepening search can expand the top level nodes repeatedly (via depth limited search) for each iteration. The worst case is when the solution is at maximum possible depth, again by having the agent visit all possible squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: For uniform cost search, the worst case time-complexity is linear in number of squares that can be visited. For iterative deepening search, the worst case time-complexity is quadratic in number of squares that can be visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Worst case for Space Complexity:}$ Uniform cost search is effectively best first graph search with a fixed cost function. Hence, it is worst case space complexity is linear in number of squares that can be visited. \n",
    "\n",
    "For iterative deepening search, the main memory usage is the list structure keeping track of the frontier. Not every square can be the frontier at a certain depth. Intuitively, the set of squares that can be frontiers at a given depth is the set of squares that have L0-Norm (taxicab metric) distance = depth from the initial starting square. The L0-norm was a heuristic used in the A*-search. Due to properties of the L0-Norm, the maximum number of squares in the frontier scales linearly with the depth. The worst case is achieved when there are no walls and the map is a square. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: The space-complexity for uniform cost search is linear in number of squares that can be visited. The space-complexity for iterative deepening search is linear with respect to the length of the map. (square root of the total number of squares.)\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Completeness:}$ Both algorithms can visit all possible squares, hence both algorithms are complete. They will also report failure to find solution if that is the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: Both algorithms are complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Cost optimality:}$ Both algorithms returned the optimal path in this instance. However, only the uniform cost search takes into account the cost. Iterative deepening search can product a non cost-optimal path if that path is at a lower depth than the cost-optimal path. One such possibility is having an L shaped wall with a long vertical component but a short horizontal one. Set the starting point at the corner of the L shaped wall, and the goal at the corner on the other side. Moving vertically around the top of the L shaped wall produces a longer path but smaller cost as compared to going horizontally to the side. This is because horizontal movements incur 10-times the cost compared to vertical movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform cost search is always cost optimal because it always makes moves that incurs a lower total cost first before making higher cost moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: Both algorithm are cost optimal in this instance, but there are instances where iterative deepening search is not. Uniform cost search is always cost optimal."
